<p><b>I’m not an OG, I started playing the game when it went F2P on every platform just a couple of days ago at the time this review aired. I’m absolutely addicted, I think the game is a breath of fresh air and I’m happy a lot of players, both OG and new, are giving the game recognition like how everyone once was back in Summer 2020, almost feels like history is repeating itself.<p><b>
<div>
<p><b>The gameplay is simple yet addicting, it’s 60 players surviving on numerous courses until the last player surviving wins, it’s amazing and the simple aspects of the gameplay keep me coming back for more<p><b>.
<div>

<p><b>I appreciate everything new the team has added to the game because the game definitely needed it since the beginning, a new currency system, F2P, on Xbox and switch, cross-play and progression, bug fixes, consistent and good content, this is what the game should’ve had since the beginning, idk if they did this so they’d get even more players or if they actually couldn’t add these at launch.
<div>
<p><b>The game has glaring issues though, first off, the entire PS5 port of the game is bugged, I play on PS5 and I have to play the PS4 version of the game because the invites, my epic friend list, and matchmaking don’t work at all on the PS5 version, I can’t receive invites or send them to my buddies, and I can’t even load into a match, despite me being able to do so on the PS4 version, I could tell the PS5 version was bugged because it takes up 3GB of storage, whereas the PS4 version takes nearly 8GB, the PS5 version obviously needs more time in the oven, and I hope they iron out all the issues for it.<p><b>
<div>
<p><b>Also, just a small idea to make this game even better than it already is. Add a private lobby system with a map creator, and add 10-15 player lobbies just for private matches, ik this sounds like too much but this would be an amazing addition and would extend the longevity of the game.<p><b>
<div>
<p><b>But overall I’m very happy with Fall Guys, I’m happy I get to play with my friends on Xbox now, and everything new they’ve added is amazing. I want to see them do a lot with this game because I don’t want to see this game drown in the water like it did throughout the entirety of 2021.<p><b>
<div>

<b><p>I do agree with this review because I always have fun when I get on to Fall Guys the simple design makes it easy to understand and even funner to play. They update the game to give it new maps and new modes to help it keep it fresh. The best decision that they made was making the game free to play making it easy to access.<p><b>

<p><b>My dream rig would be prebuilt from build redux because they would be a better option for me and get a way bigger upgrade from the PC I have now. This is a good choice because they are a good and reliable company that has sponsored many people in the past and still supports them to this day. My pc I have now is not the best but if I buy a PC from Redux I would go from a 760 to a 4060.<p><b>

<b><p>A good survival game could be scary and make you work for everything. It should also punish you if you die or mess up in that game,
A good survival game would be Minecraft. I say this because it would be the most basic one but an amazing example. It makes you work for everything and punishes you if you die and you can't get back to your times in time. One of the worst survival games is Resident Evil 6 because of how it tried to appeal to a wider audience. When they tried to appeal to a wider audience they ended up taking out how hard the game was and all the survival accepts of it.<p><b>

Article:https://www.wired.com/story/toxicity-in-gaming-is-dangerous-heres-how-to-stand-up-to-it/
<b><p>Toxicity in gaming is when someone is being mean or rude in on your team or the other team. This could include being racist, saying slurs, or saying sensitive information. It is important to understand because it could make people go away from gaming and stay away from it from a previous toxic experience. We can combat this by telling them to stop and confronting them or reporting them, blocking them, and muting them.<p><b>

<b><p>One of the best Fortnite teams is Elite Esports. They are a good team because they have some of the most consistent players placing high. one thing they could do better is get more players in different regions.
